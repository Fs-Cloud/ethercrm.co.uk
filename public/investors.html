                    Risks of Investing Investing entails risks, including possible loss of principal. No representation is being made that any investment or transaction will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those achieved in the past, or that significant
                    losses will be avoided. No assurances or guarantees are given regarding the performance of any investment.
                    </br>
                    Past performance may not be repeated and should not be seen as a guide to future performance. The value of investments and the income from them may go down as well as up and investors may not get back the amount originally invested. Exchange rates may
                    cause the value of overseas investments and the income arising from them to rise or fall. The levels and bases of and reliefs from taxation may change. Any tax reliefs referred to are those currently available and their value depends
                    on the circumstances of the individual investor. Investors should consult their own tax adviser in order to understand any applicable tax consequences. Materials relating to the investments mentioned on this Website should be read
                    in conjunction with a prospectus (available through this Website) that describes charges, expenses, and risks. Read it carefully before any investment.
